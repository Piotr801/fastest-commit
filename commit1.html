		<div class="ppCol-sm-12">We know that a lot of places dont have energy and cant use electricity because of this reason.
		Energy we use is very important because of it we can heat up our houses, we can have light at night time and we can even use it for some cars that we have in this time. Other things we can use it for is internet to accsess social media or other important things.
		Some counteies that bearly have energy are Burundi, Chad, Central African Republic and Liberia. One of the biggest ones that have no energy are Central African Republic. Reason why is because they cant produce any gasses or petroleum which are one ways that can create energy.

		<div class="ppCol-sm-12">The countries that dont have energy can be very severe in most cases it can cause very bad health crisis because of it. You wouldnt be able to clean yourself with warm water or use the energy for work such as using the internet to contact with other people about coming in to work or if you or someone else are planning a very important meeting or even go online to buy holiday vaccation with your family or friends. Energy is very important and not all countries can have enough to use it the way others can use it which is why its good to help and allow everyone to have accsess to energy.
		</div>
		<br>
		<br>
		<div class="ppCol-sm-12">Another important thing is that countries that dont have any energy cant use electricity to work most machines that create fuel for us so they would need to do with by working for many hours a day. And because of that people cant spend time with their families or with friends because they dont have any energy to provide for their families at home. Countries who have very litle energy have problems because they can't cook food for them and families so they have to eat cold food and they cant warm themselves because they cant have a heater in their house.

		<br>
		<div class="ppCol-sm-12">
				The countries that have very little energy have alot of problems till this day and it can reduce their health alot because of it.
				There is a few ways we could help in solving the problem which we will need to use some specific things to make those solutions managable. Some ways we could make this possible is by using modern energy such as the sun which gives out alot of energy. Another way we could do that is by mining and gathering coal and oil to covert into energy which could help a lot aswell for a lot of people.
